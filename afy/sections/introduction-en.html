<span class="markdown">We wish to propose a knowledge model that will provide a unifying framework for structuring agroforestry data and knowledge,
		thereby simplifying the construction of knowledge bases in this field.
		Data from observations play a key role in understanding the mechanisms governing agroforestry systems and can also establish their justification by comparison
		with agricultural systems on the one hand and forestry systems on the other.
		The aim is therefore also to be able to pool information from several knowledge bases built from agroforestry systems of the same or different types.</span>

<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
In order for a semantic system dedicated to agroforestry developments to be shared by all agroforestry stakeholders, and even by stakeholders in other fields given the systemic nature of agroforestry, it seems essential to maintain a high level of generality in the definition of the ontology. The vision adopted is as follows: an agroforestry plot evolves over time and space and has biotic and abiotic sub-parts, which are considered as simple or decomposable elements with intrinsic properties (specific characteristics) that form interrelationships of various kinds. We were particularly interested in the spatial relationships that underlie the different developments specific to each plot. Every element, property or relationship in the ontology can potentially be enriched by one or more terms/concepts from terminological ontologies. These terms, used to describe each element of an agroforestry arrangement, as well as their properties and interrelationships, involve either the reuse of existing terminological ontologies.</span>
